# Todo Checklist App

My first project to familiarize myself with github and web development using react. This is a simple todo checklist application built using React. It allows users to add, toggle, and delete todo items. The application persists todo items in the browser's local storage, so the todos will be retained even after refreshing the page.

## Features

- Add new todo items
- Mark todo items as completed or incomplete
- Delete todo items
- Persist todo items in local storage

## Technologies Used

- React
- JavaScript
- HTML
- CSS

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   `git clone https://github.com/Dhiya-Natarajan/todo-app/tree/main/todo-app`


2. Navigate into the project directory:
   `cd todo-app`
   
4. Install dependencies:
   `npm install`
   
5. Run the application:
   `npm start`

   
The application will open in your default web browser at `http://localhost:3000`.

## Usage

- To add a new todo item, type the task in the input field and press Enter.
- To mark a todo item as completed, click on the checkbox next to the item.
- To delete a todo item, click on the delete button next to the item.
