# Todo Checklist App

My first project to familiarize myself with github and web development using react. This is a simple todo checklist application built using React. It allows users to add, toggle, and delete todo items. The application persists todo items in the browser's local storage, so the todos will be retained even after refreshing the page.

- Add new todo items
- Mark todo items as completed or incomplete
- Delete todo items
- Persist todo items in local storage

## Technologies Used

The application will open in your default web browser at `http://localhost:3000`.
